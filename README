This is my package of two scripts I wrote up to work with my TiVo
Series 3 to my linux box in terms of downloading content.

TiVo2Disk
---------
TiVo2Disk is a simple downloading application.  It downloads the shows
requested, and pipes them through tivodecode so you end with a useful
mpg file.

TiVo2Disk requires:
 o rubygems
 o httpclient gem
 o facets gem
 o tivodecode from http://tivodecode.sourceforge.net/

This was tested on both OS X and Linux.

TiVo2Podcast
------------

TiVo2Podcast was my attempt to pipeline downloading shows, transcoding
them to be iPhone friendly, and then put them into an podcast friendly
RSS feed for easy loading and unloading into iTunes/iPhone/etc.

TiVo2Podcast requires:
 o rubygems
 o httpclient gem
 o facets gem
 o tivodecode
 o sqlite3 and its ruby interface
 o AtomicParsley from http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net/
 o HandBrakeCLI from http://handbrake.fr/

This has been tested (and used daily) on Linux
